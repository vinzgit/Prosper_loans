# Prosper Loan Exploration
## by Vincent Hamel


## Dataset

>  The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans from Prosper with a number of parameters describing each loan. The dataset can be found on the following link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv.


## Summary of Findings

> When we started analyzing the relationship between the main variables we have noted an interesting correlation between the APR and the Prosper rating and the average credit score. A higher rating and a higher score would give rise to a lower APR.

For the loan status a better rating would reduce the probability of a default or a charged off loan which is even more relevant with a higher monthly income. We have also demonstrated that a higher debt to income ratio would increase the likelihood of a default however it was interesting to note that a home owner will be less likely to default that someone who does not own a house.

Finally a lower employment duration would increase the probability of a default but the loan amounts would tend to be smaller than those that were completed successfully.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The two key features are the loan status and the APR. I chose to start with the distribution of these two variables.
I have presented the relationship of the APR with other quantitative variables using a heatmap chart and added a title including for the color bar. 
I have also included the loan status chart which compares it to the loan amount and the employment duration. I have included titles, cleared up the background for a better data-ink ratio and updated the xticks labels.

Note: I have not used outside sources or requested any feedback which I believe was optional.
